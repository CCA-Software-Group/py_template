This is a basic template for a Python repository, with the components needed to develop and release an open source software package. These include unit tests; type annotations; a documentation site with an API; and continuous integration for tests, code coverage, linting/formatting, type checking, publishing the docs, and releasing the software as a `pip`-installable package.

See the [docs](https://cca-software-group.github.io/py_template/) for a 'Getting Started' guide with a description of the repo's contents, steps on how to make your own Python repo using this template, and what to do next to build your own package.
